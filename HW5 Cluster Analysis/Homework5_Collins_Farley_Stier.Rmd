# The Dataset

*Raw dataset:*
COVID-19 infection and death statistics from U.S. counties (sourced from NYT), combined with economic, education, and population data (sourced from various government agencies) and also survey responses about mask-wearing frequencies (sourced from NYT). 3141 complete observations on 19 metric variables and 6 categorical variables. To avoid any outliers due to population size differences between counties, all variables are scaled as a percentage of population. Variable descriptions can be found [here](http://evancollins.com/variable_descriptions.html).

*Data of relevance for this pset:*

Categorical Predictor 1 (rural_urban_code): The Rural-Urban Codes are numbered 1-9 according to descriptions provided by the USDA. We will regroup codes 1 through 9 as into three groups: (1) "Urban" for codes 1-3, (2) "Suburban" for codes 4-6, and (3) "Rural" for codes 7-9.

Categorical Predictor 2 (region): Each county is associated with a state name, which we will group into regions as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.

3 Continuous Response Variables: A NYT survey about masking behaviors asked people whether they wear a mask in public when they expect to be within 6 feet of another person and calculated the responses for each county for never, rarely, sometimes, frequently, and always mask. We choose to look at the extremes and will examine 3 continuous response variables: never mask, sometimes mask, and always mask.

raw <- readr::read_csv("https://evancollins.com/covid_and_demographics.csv")

      State_Name %in% c("Washington", "Oregon", "California", "Nevada", "Idaho", "Montana", "Utah", "Arizona", "Wyoming", "Colorado", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Hawaii") ~ "West",
      State_Name %in% c("North Dakota", "South Dakota", "Nebraska", "Kansas", "Minnesota", "Iowa", "Missouri", "Wisconsin", "Illinois", "Michigan", "Indiana", "Ohio") ~ "Midwest",
      State_Name %in% c("Texas", "Oklahoma", "Arkansas", "Louisiana", "Mississippi", "Tennessee", "Kentucky", "Alabama", "Georgia", "Florida", "South Carolina", "North Carolina", "Virginia", "West Virginia", "District of Columbia", "Delaware", "Maryland") ~ "South",

        Rural_Urban_Code_2013 %in% c(7, 8, 9) ~ "Rural")

# 1 Distance Metrics
Think about what distance metrics are appropriate for your data based on data type. Write a few sentences about this.  Also think about whether you should standardize and/or transform your data (comment as appropriate).

# 2 Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
Try various forms of hierarchical cluster analysis.  Try at least two different distance metrics and two agglomeration methods.  Produce dendrograms and comment on what you observe.

# 3 If possible, run the SAS macro or the R function to think about how many groups you want to retain (i.e. get the plots of cluster distance, R-squared, etc).  If you canâ€™t run this, discuss how many groups you think are present.  

# 4 Run k-means clustering on your data.  Compare results to what you got in 3.)  Include a sum of squares vs. k (number of clusters) plot and comment on how many groups exist.

# 5 Comment on the number of groups that seem to be present based on what you find above.

# 6 Write a few sentences describing your final groups.
